Freedom of speech is the right to express ideas, beliefs, and criticism without fear of government punishment, and it’s a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.
It lets people challenge those in power, share unpopular opinions, and drive social change. But it isn’t absolute: most legal systems restrict direct threats, incitement to violence, and narrowly defined harms like defamation. 
The hard part is balancing open debate with protections against real harm, especially online where speech spreads fast and at scale. 
At its best, free speech protects the space for truth-seeking, creativity, and accountability—while asking all of us to use that freedom responsibly.
